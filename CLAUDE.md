# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal portfolio website (vCard) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a Jekyll-compatible site that can be deployed to GitHub Pages. 

## Development Setup

### Simple HTTP Server (Recommended)
- No Ruby/Jekyll dependencies required
- Run local development server: `./serve.sh` or `python3 -m http.server 4000`
- Works with the dynamic configuration system out of the box

### Jekyll Development (Alternative)
- **Note**: Jekyll has compatibility issues with Ruby 3.4+
- **Solution 1 - Simple Server**: Use `./serve.sh` (recommended)
- **Solution 2 - Docker**: Use `./docker-serve.sh` (if Docker is installed)
- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Build site: `bundle exec jekyll build`

### Static File Structure
- Main entry point: `index.html`
- Styles: `assets/css/style.css`
- JavaScript: `assets/js/script.js`
- Images: `assets/images/`
- Generated site: `_site/` (auto-generated by Jekyll)

## File Organization
- All source files are in the root directory
- Assets organized in `assets/` subdirectories
- Jekyll builds to `_site/` directory
- Demo images in `website-demo-image/`

## Deployment
- Configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- Uses Jekyll for static site generation
- No build process required for static version - files can be served directly
